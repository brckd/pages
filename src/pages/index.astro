      <h1>Hello, Mom! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
        And glad you found my cozy place on the interwebz! This is where I do big boys stuff like
        blogging and hosting my projects :D However, this site is still
        <abbr title="Work in Progress">WIP</abbr>, so stay tuned!
      </p>
      <p>
        Do check out my <a href="/about">About Me</a> to learn more about me or to say hi! Also check
        out <a href="https://linerly.xyz">Linerly's webzsite</a>, which inspired me to do this in
        the first place :o
