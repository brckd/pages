## The Stylix Story

### Configuration hellscape

What's a better time to waste your own time than to customize your desktop?
Heck, there are entire communities like
[Unixporn](https://lemmy.world/c/unixporn) based around this hobby. I myself
have spent countless months on this, as far back as
[my first post about custom setups](/blog/my-first-custom-linux-setup). It can
be really fun at first, but after the honeymoon phase is over, it quickly
becomes tiring. The hardest part for me has always been configuring color
schemes, because manualy doing so was a lot of efford.

In the configuration from the aforementioned post, I used Arch, which is famous
for its customizability. There, I settled on using
[Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal), which is a handy CLI tool that
generates a color scheme from my wallpaper and could output it in various file
formats. _Note: Pywal has been archived, but
[pywal16](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16) looks like a good successor._

There are also other tools like
[Tinted Theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) (previously base16) and
[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com) that do the same, but with a fixed set of
color schemes. Nonetheless, this was still too much work for me, because it
involved the manual step of finding out where to put the generated files for
each application I was using.

### Nix

Nowadays, I'm not using Arch anymore. Instead I'm using another Linux-based
operating system called NixOS. It is just as customizable as Arch, but it uses a
different package manager and configuration system called Nix.

Nix is made unique by the way it lets you write a single configuration file and
use it anywhere you want! Gone are the days of crawling through the settings on
every new device you set up. Since the configuration is also text-based, it's
often uploaded to platforms like GitHub where it can be shared with others, e.g.
in the form of so-called
[Flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/introduction-to-flakes).

### The solution

Bluntly put, [Stylix](https://stylix.danth.me) is just a Flake like every other
Flake before it. But I think it's so much more, because it takes the core
selling point of Nix and elevates it to another level! Similarily to Nix, Stylix
takes your preferences and applies them anywhere you want. But Stylix does so
with your styling preferences and to a variety of applications.

In contrast to the other tools I mentioned however, Stylix isn't just limited to
just color schemes: It can also do wallpapers, fonts and even icon packs. It
doesn't even matter whether you're using GNOME, KDE, or Hyprland -- Stylix can
probably already style your entire desktop. And if it doesn't, you can just
[contribute a module](https://stylix.danth.me/modules.html#module-template) or
[use its templating engine](https://stylix.danth.me/modules.html#how-to-apply-colors)
in your own configuration!

## Demo

Just because I'm so proud of my configuration and you probably want to know what
Stylix would look like, here is a quick demo from
[my own NixOS configuration](https://nixdots.bricked.dev).

As you can see, Stylix can style any application, be it browsers, terminals,
Spicetify, or even modded Discord clients. In addition to that, all native GTK
and QT applications are supported, which should cover most Linux needs. In fact,
my current NixOS configuration doesn't have a single app that's not styled using
Stylix!

## Try it yourself

If you are now as hyped about Stylix as I am, just head over to its
documentation on the
[installation process](https://stylix.danth.me/installation.html). Vimjoyer has
also made [a great video](https://youtu.be/ljHkWgBaQWU) covering this process.
Additionally, Stylix provides [testbeds](https://stylix.danth.me/testbeds.html)
which let you preview application themes before installing them. You can run
these on any system with Nix installed, but be told that they might take some
time to compile.

This has been my first long-form blog post, so if you have any feedback or
suggestions, make sure to [get in contact with me](/socials) until I implement a
