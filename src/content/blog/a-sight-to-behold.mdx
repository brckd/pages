Before [the first rewrite](/blog/undergoing-an-overhaul), this blog actually had banner images, because I used a template that supported it. Now I have implemented this functionality myself and integrated it with the new design language.

So far, not many blog posts have an image, but I'll probably add them retroactively. I plan to illustrate them in the same style of my [new avatar](/blog/the-glow-up-is-real). So get ready to be greeted more often by that friendly face!
