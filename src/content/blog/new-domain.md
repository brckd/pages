Following
[Linerly's announcement](https://linerly.xyz/en/blog/a-new-domain-name-that-i-finally-own/) exactly
one month ago, my very own website now has its very own domain too! This means that
`bricked.vercel.app` is now the much shorter `bricked.dev`, but the old domain will still redirect
to the new one for a while.

Any emails to `@bricked.dev` will also be forwarded to my personal email. You can try it now by
sending an email to [`hello@bricked.dev`](mailto:hello@bricked.dev)!

I actually used NameCheap's newest spin-off brand, Spaceship to buy the domain, because my preferred
option, PorkBun didn't accept my new credit card for some reason. I just hope that NameCheap won't
inflate the initially cheap prices until i can fix that issue.
