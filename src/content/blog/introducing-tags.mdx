Finally, I added tags to the blog! Just click on any tag and you will see all blog posts that have it.

I actually wanted to implement this feature ever since this blog existed. This is the first update to the blog after [I teased a transformation of this website](/blog/the-glow-up-is-real/) and I'm now confident that more exciting updates will follow!

That's all from this short update, but stay tuned for more updates in the following week :)
