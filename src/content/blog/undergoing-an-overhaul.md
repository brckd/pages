For a couple of days now, this website looks different from before. This is because, after the first version of the website introduced in [my first post](./welcome-to-my-blog), I finally got to style the website completely myself. It may not look as aesthetically pleasing as before, but it's something I can work with.

This is part of a complete overhaul of my online appearance. My previous avatars were all variations of a blue Lego brick with eyes, whereas the new one is simplified to just a brick made of brackets and eyes. This makes it possible to type my avatar in ASCII-characters as `[ ]`, kinda like the `moz://a` logo. I also decided to stylize my name as lowercase `bricked`, because it looks stylish, duh!

Over the past couple of months I also built an entire to-do list of blog posts and other projects, so stay tuned as always!
