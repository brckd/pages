Following
[Linerly's announcement](https://linerly.xyz/en/blog/a-new-domain-name-that-i-finally-own/) exactly
one month ago, my very own website now has its very own domain too! This means that
`bricked.vercel.app` is now the much shorter `bricked.dev`, but the old domain will still redirect
to the new one for a while.

Any emails to `@bricked.dev` will also be forwarded to my personal email. You can try it now by
sending an email to [`hello@bricked.dev`](mailto:hello@bricked.dev)!

I actually used NameCheap's newest spin-off brand, Spaceship to buy the domain, because my preferred
option, PorkBun didn't accept my new credit card for some reason. I just hope that NameCheap won't
inflate the initially cheap prices until i can fix that issue.

Update: This was an issue with my credit card service. It's fixed now and I'm happily using PorkBun for some of my newer domains. Luckily it seems that Spaceship hasn't enshittificated yet.
